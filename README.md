# Asteroids

For my final project as a freshman, I took it upon myself to recreate (to the best of my ability) the game asteroids. This project challenged me to understand how oop works, and it came out better than I had originally hoped. Since then, I've come back to this project to organize my different files into classes (like you would expect to see in a java project) for the sake of better readability. At some point, I'd like to create a scoring system as well as a lives system so that it could be an actual game.
